# website-checker

This application checks the availability of websites. It reads a list of URLs provided in the config.txt file. The results are then recorded in result.txt, indicating whether each site is accessible or not.

Files
config.txt: This file contains the list of URLs, which should be formatted as https or http://www.website.domain (such as .com, .nl, .be, etc.).
log.txt: This file logs any error messages encountered.
result.txt: This file contains the results for the websites checked.

The result.txt and log.txt files are automatically created when you run the application for the first time.
